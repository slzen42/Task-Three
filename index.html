            <h3>Ancient Greek Architecture</h3>
            <p>Ancient Greek architecture is distinguished by its highly formalized characteristics, both of structure and decoration. This is most evident in the temples and public buildings constructed in ancient Greece, such as the Parthenon in Athens and the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.</p>
            <p>The ancient Greeks developed three architectural styles known as orders: the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The simplest and sturdiest order with plain, saucer-shaped capitals and columns without bases.">Doric</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The more slender and elegant order, recognized by its scroll-like volutes on the capitals and bases for the columns.">Ionic</span>, and <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The most ornate order, characterized by elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves.">Corinthian</span> orders. Each order has its unique characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Doric Order:</strong> The Doric order is the simplest and sturdiest. It features plain, saucer-shaped capitals and columns without bases.</li>
                <li><strong>Ionic Order:</strong> The Ionic order is more slender and elegant. It is easily recognized by its scroll-like volutes on the capitals and bases for the columns.</li>
                <li><strong>Corinthian Order:</strong> The Corinthian order is the most ornate, characterized by elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Greek temples were designed to house the cult statue of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated. They were built to be admired from the outside and often positioned on elevated ground for maximum visual impact.</p>
            <p>Besides temples, the Greeks also built theaters, stadiums, and other public buildings. These structures were often designed with careful attention to proportions and symmetry, reflecting the Greeks' appreciation for harmony and balance.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Greek architecture influenced the development of Roman architecture and, through it, architecture to the present day. Many of the styles and techniques pioneered by the Greeks can be seen in later periods, including the Renaissance and Neoclassical movements.</p>
            <p>Greek houses typically consisted of two or three rooms, built around a courtyard, with the kitchen, bathing rooms, and toilet on the ground floor. Wealthier Greeks had larger homes with additional rooms and finer furnishings. The materials used were often stone, wood, and clay bricks.</p>
            <p>Public spaces in Greek cities included the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The central public space in ancient Greek city-states, used for assemblies and markets.">agora</span> (marketplace) and the gymnasium, where citizens could engage in commerce and physical activities. These areas were essential to the social and economic life of the city-state.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3 id="about-greece">Ancient Greece</h3>
            <p>Ancient Greece, a civilization that flourished from around the 8th century BCE to the end of antiquity (c. 600 AD), is renowned for its contributions to modern philosophy, politics, art, and science.

            <p>Greek city-states, such as <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A powerful city-state in ancient Greece, known for its influential role in the development of democracy.">Athens</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A prominent city-state in ancient Greece, known for its military prowess and austere lifestyle.">Sparta</span>, were known for their distinct forms of government and societal structure.

            <h3 id="about-architecture">Greek Architecture</h3>
            <p>Greek architecture is known for its tall columns, symmetrical shapes, and intricate details. Temples were the most important and widespread form of Greek architecture, used to worship gods and goddesses.</p>
            <p>Temples were not the only significant structures in Ancient Greece. Theaters were another prominent type of building, reflecting the importance of drama and performance in Greek culture. The open-air theaters, such as the Theatre of Epidaurus, were ingeniously designed to provide excellent acoustics and visibility for large audiences.</p>
            <p>The Greeks also constructed impressive public buildings, including the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Covered walkways or porticos, commonly used for public usage in ancient Greece.">stoas</span> (covered walkways) and the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Council houses in ancient Greek city-states.">bouleuterion</span> (council houses). These buildings were central to public life and served as places for political and social gatherings.</p>
            <p>In addition to their architectural innovations, the Greeks developed significant urban planning concepts. The grid plan, attributed to <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="An ancient Greek architect, urban planner, and philosopher, often called the father of urban planning.">Hippodamus of Miletus</span>, was a revolutionary idea that influenced city planning in the Hellenistic period and beyond. This methodical approach to urban design can be seen in the layout of cities like Piraeus and Priene.</p>

            <h3 id="about-history">Greek History</h3>
            <p>Ancient Greek history is rich and varied, covering a wide range of topics and periods. The early Greek civilization began with the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="An ancient civilization known for its palatial centers and significant influence on Greek culture and mythology.">Mycenaean</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A Bronze Age civilization that arose on the island of Crete and had a significant influence on Greek culture.">Minoan</span> civilizations, which laid the groundwork for the classical period.</p>
            <p>The classical period saw the rise of city-states (poleis), each with its unique culture and political system. Major events, such as the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A series of conflicts between the Greek city-states and the Persian Empire in the 5th century BCE.">Persian Wars</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A protracted conflict between Athens and Sparta, along with their respective allies, lasting from 431 to 404 BCE.">Peloponnesian War</span>, shaped the course of Greek history and influenced the political landscape of the region.</p>
            <p>The Hellenistic period followed the conquests of <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon, known for his extensive empire and spread of Greek culture.">Alexander the Great</span>, during which Greek culture spread throughout the known world. This era saw the blending of Greek, Persian, Egyptian, and other cultures, leading to significant advancements in art, science, and philosophy.</p>
